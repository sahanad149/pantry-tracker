A pantry management using Next.js, MaterialUI and Firebase

Efficient inventory management is crucial for company's of all sizes.

This app enables users to add items to their inventory, monitor quantities, and remove items when they're sold or used. We'll leverage Next.js as our React framework, Material UI for creating a sleek and responsive user interface, and Firebase Firestore as our backend database.

Steps:
1. Create a Next.js app using npx create-next-app@latest
2. Install MaterialUI
3. Remove the .css styles since we will be using MUI.
